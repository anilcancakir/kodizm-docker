description: Plan execution engine. Dispatches wave-based parallel plan-worker subagents with tier-aware model routing, verifies done-when criteria, escalates failed tiers, runs post-wave tests, delivers dev_report.
when-to-use: When a task has an approved plan section ready for implementation. Triggers after dev-planning completes. Do NOT use for planning, analysis, or review.

# Dev Execute

Take an approved plan and turn it into working code through orchestrated plan-worker subagents, wave-based parallelism, and layered verification.

## Phase 1: Load Plan

1. `get-task-sections` to retrieve all sections. Find the section with `type=plan`
2. Parse the plan section. Extract: complexity, waves, steps (with tier + files + done-when), conventions, must-not-have
3. If no plan section exists: `report-progress(status: blocked, message: "No plan section found")` and STOP
4. Derive complexity when not explicit: 1-2 steps = simple, 3-6 = standard, 7+ = complex
5. Codebase state escalation: if project is Chaotic/Legacy, escalate all `quick` tiers to `mid`
6. `report-progress(status: implementing, percentage: 5)`
7. `create-task-section(type: notes, title: "Execution Log")` for persistent state

## Phase 2: Execute

### Simple Plans (1-2 steps)

Implement directly. No worker subagents needed. Read existing code, follow plan, write implementation + tests, run tests. Skip to Phase 3.

### Standard and Complex Plans

Execute wave-by-wave. Each wave contains steps that can run in parallel.

#### 2a. Report Execution Strategy

Before launching workers, display via `report-progress`:

```
## Execution Strategy
**Plan**: [title] | **Steps**: N | **Waves**: N | **Complexity**: [simple/standard/complex]

### Wave 1 (parallel)
- Step 1: [title] - [tier] - [files]
- Step 2: [title] - [tier] - [files]

### Wave 2 (after Wave 1)
- Step 3: [title] - [tier] - depends on Steps 1, 2
```

#### 2b. Launch Workers (parallel per wave)

For each step in the current wave, spawn a plan-worker subagent:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "plan-worker",
  model: {tier_model},
  run_in_background: true,
  prompt: {step_briefing}
)
```

**Tier to Model Mapping:**

| Tier | Model | Reasoning Budget | Use Case |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| `quick` | haiku | Minimal | Mechanical changes, single file, copy-paste patterns |
| `mid` | sonnet | Standard | Multi-file implementation, moderate logic (DEFAULT) |
| `senior` | opus | Deep | Cross-layer architecture, complex integrations |

#### 2c. Wave Barrier

Wait for ALL workers in the wave to complete. Never start the next wave early.

#### 2d. Per-Step Verification

For each completed worker:

1. Read worker output (changes + test results)
2. Verify done-when criteria: Read/Grep changed files, check each criterion
3. If ALL criteria met: proceed to diagnostics check
4. If ANY criterion unmet: **tier escalation retry** (see below)
5. Check LSP diagnostics on modified files. ERROR = fix before done. WARNING = log, continue

**Tier Escalation on Failure:**

| Original Tier | Retry Model | Max Retries |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| `quick` | sonnet (mid) | 1 |
| `mid` | opus (senior) | 1 |
| `senior` | no escalation | 0 |

Pass the failure context (what failed, why, worker output) to the retry worker. If retry also fails, mark step failed in execution log.

#### 2e. Wisdom Extraction

After verifying all steps in a wave:

1. Extract actionable patterns from worker outputs: naming conventions, DI style, file organization, gotchas, error patterns
2. Append to accumulated wisdom (max 5 items per wave, max 15 total). Skip generic statements, only keep actionable discoveries
3. `update-task-section` on execution log with: completed waves, failed steps with reasons, accumulated wisdom with wave/step annotations

#### 2f. Post-Wave Testing

Run the project's test suite for affected files after each wave:

1. Identify test files related to the wave's changes
2. Run targeted tests (not full suite)
3. If tests fail: identify which step caused the failure, attempt targeted fix
4. If fix fails: log as failed step in execution notes

#### 2g. Progress Update

`report-progress(percentage: {wave_progress})` calculated as: `(completed_waves / total_waves) * 70 + 10`

Repeat 2a-2g for each wave.

## Plan-Worker Briefing

Consistent briefing format — ONE template for all tiers. Tier determines model routing only, not prompt verbosity. Model capability handles complexity.

### Code Steps

```
## Task

**Overall Goal**: [Plan title — 1-2 sentences]
**Your Assignment**: [Step title]
[Full step description]

## Expected Outcome

**Files to Modify**: [paths]
**Acceptance Criteria**: [done-when, verbatim]
**QA**: [test scenarios from plan]

## Must Do

- Follow CLAUDE.md conventions (already in your context) + plan conventions below
- [PLAN_CONVENTIONS — plan-specific only, not generic coding rules already in CLAUDE.md]
- Read existing files before modifying — understand context
- Implement ONLY your assigned step + run verification after changes
- If tests fail, fix root cause — do not skip or modify tests to pass

## Must NOT Do

Stay in scope — no out-of-scope files, no bonus refactors, no annotations on unchanged code.

[If build/test/lint commands available:]
## Build/Test Commands
[build/test/lint commands from plan or project config]

[If accumulated wisdom exists:]
## Wisdom from prior steps
Prefer these over re-discovering:
[accumulated wisdom items]

## Constraints

- Scope: ONLY the files and changes described above
- No new dependencies unless the step explicitly requires them
- No modifications to files outside your assignment

## Output Format

### Changes Made
- `file:line` — [what changed]

### Verification
- Build: [command] → [PASS/FAIL]
- Tests: [command] → [N pass, N fail]
- Lint: [command] → [PASS/FAIL]

### Issues (if any)
- [description]
```

### Infrastructure Steps (Type: infra)

Same base template with infrastructure-specific fields:

```
## Task

**Overall Goal**: [Plan title — 1-2 sentences]
**Your Assignment**: [Step title]
[Full step description]

## Expected Outcome

**Target**: [SSH connection string from plan, e.g., "ssh -p 13664 user@host"]
**Commands**: [Commands from plan step]
**Acceptance Criteria**: [done-when, verbatim]

Execute commands via Bash tool (SSH to target). Verify done-when after each command group. Report connection details and command outputs.

## Must Do

- [PLAN_CONVENTIONS — plan-specific only]

## Must NOT Do

Stay in scope — only the commands and targets described above.

[If accumulated wisdom exists:]
## Wisdom from prior steps
Prefer these over re-discovering:
[accumulated wisdom items]
```

## Phase 3: Verify

After all waves complete, run the full test suite. Then apply verification based on complexity.

Initialize VERIFY_RETRY_COUNT = 0.

### Simple (build + test + lint only)

Run build + test + lint. All pass → proceed to Phase 4. Any failure → fix and re-run.

No verification agent for Simple plans.

### Standard (plan-code-review)

Run build + test + lint. Then spawn a single consolidated review (foreground):

```
Agent(subagent_type: "plan-code-review", prompt: "Review implementation against plan. Modified files: [list]. Plan conventions: [PLAN_CONVENTIONS].")
```

This agent performs compliance verification (done-when, must-not-have, scope), spec compliance, and code quality in one pass. APPROVED → Phase 4. BLOCKED → fix, re-verify.

### Complex (plan-code-review with opus)

Run build + test + lint. Then spawn a single consolidated deep review (foreground):

```
Agent(subagent_type: "plan-code-review", model: opus, prompt: "Deep review. Modified files: [list]. Conventions: [PLAN_CONVENTIONS]. Full review: compliance, spec, quality, cross-layer integration, architectural impact.")
```

APPROVED → Phase 4. BLOCKED → fix, re-verify.

### 3-Strike Rule

After 3 total verification failures across all layers:

1. Stop. Do not attempt more fixes
2. `create-task-section(type: notes, title: "Verification Failed")` with unmet criteria, attempts made, remaining issues
3. `report-progress(status: blocked, percentage: 90)`
4. Do NOT transition task. Leave in `in_progress` for human intervention

## Phase 4: Deliver

1. Git commit via `/git-master` (auto-detects commit style). You are in an isolated worktree, branch is checked out. Do NOT push (platform handles this). Do NOT switch branches (breaks worktree isolation)
2. `create-task-section(type: dev_report)` with structured report (format below)
3. `report-progress(status: complete, percentage: 100)`

### Dev Report Format

## Failure Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Worker returns incomplete output | Read changed files directly. If changes exist, verify manually and continue |
| Wave has mixed results | Continue to next wave ONLY if failed steps are not dependencies. Otherwise stop and report |
| Test suite fails after all waves | Isolate which wave introduced failure. Targeted fix. 3 attempts max, then 3-strike rule |
| Plan is unexecutable | Do NOT improvise. `report-progress(status: blocked)` with specific issues. Plan needs revision |
| Need clarification | Use `ask-user` MCP tool. Session pauses and resumes on answer |
